THE CREATIVE BRIEF

In the best cases, a creative brief is a document created through initial meetings, interviews, readings and discussions between a client and designer before any work begins. Throughout the project, the creative brief continues to inform and guide the work. A good creative brief will answer these questions:
 * What is this project? A portfolio for my projects.
 * Who is it for? For employers in the ad agency.
 * Why are we doing it? To get a job.
 * What needs to be done? By whom? By when? My portfolio site is an interactive resume for employers to see my work and it needs to be working before I apply for jobs.
 * Where and how will it be used? It will be used to send it when I start applying for jobs. 

 
 1. Background Summary: Who is the client? What is the product or service? What are the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (or SWOTs) involved with this product or service? Are there existing research, reports and other documents that help you understand the situation?
 	- Employers are currently the client for this particular website because it showcases my portfolio. Strengths include this website being a gallery. Weaknesses are that it doesn't really show my clients who I am as a person but that could be just due to content. Opportunities include expanding beyound the website and tackling other social platforms to drive viewers to the site. Threats include other creatives mostly.

 2. Overview: What is the project? What are we designing and why? Why do we need this project? Whatâ€™s the opportunity?
 	- This project is essentially an interactive resume. We are designing a portfolio to showcase employers my work and what I'm capable of. This project is to help obtain a job and it could also show employers that I can also code, which is a bonus. 

 3. Drivers: What is our goal for this project? What are we trying to achieve? What is the purpose of our work? What are our top three objectives?
 	- The ultimate goal is to impress employers with this site so I can land my dream job. 

 4. Audience: Who are we talking to? What do they think of us? Why should they care?
 	- We are speaking to anyone who would like to view my site and be able to see my work. It shows them what I can do and hopefully how I can apply it to a position at their company. 

 5. Competitors: Who is the competition? What are they telling the audience that we should be telling them? SWOT analysis on them? What differentiates us from them?
 	- Competition includes resumes of other students seeking for jobs who may have a better knowledge of coding. They're showcasing their strengths. We each have different strengths so I'm better in design, which I would show more of. 

 6. Tone: How should we be communicating? What adjectives describe the feeling or approach?
 	- The tone is calm yet intriguing. I went for a minimalist style except with bright colors to bring the viewers in. 


 7. Message: What are we saying with this piece exactly? Are the words already developed or do we need to develop them? What do we want audiences to take away?
 	- Front-end is my favorite part of coding because that's what brings the website together. The design and work speaks for itself and the audience can interpret it in many ways. 


 8. Visuals: Are we developing new images or picking up existing ones? If we are creating them, who/what/where are we photographing or illustrating? And why?
 	- This is a portfolio site so it showcases MY work. All the images are creating by me from previous classes. 


 9. Details: Any mandatory information that must be included? List of deliverables? Preconceived ideas? Format parameters? Limitations and restrictions? Timeline, schedule, budget?
 	- None. 

 10. People: Who are we reporting to? Who exactly is approving this work? Who needs to be informed of our progress? By what means?
 	- The best part of building a website for yourself is that you are the only person who gets to approve it and say what goes on it.
