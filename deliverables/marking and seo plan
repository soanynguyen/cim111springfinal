	- This portfolio website is designed by me as interactive resume to send to employers when seeking jobs this summer. I will include the link to my website at the top of my resumes when I send them in. The best way to recieve traffic on my site is to constantly send out the site and link it to my other platforms. Being a creative, instagram/facebook is the best option to expand this site.
